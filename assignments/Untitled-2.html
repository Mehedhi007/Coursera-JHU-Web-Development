    	<p>
        	Milk chocolate is chocolate with milk powder or condensed milk added. The EU regulations specify a minimum of 25% cocoa solids should be present in milk chocolate. 
        	However in the United States milk chocolate only needs to have a 10% concentration of chocolate liquor to be classified as milk chocolate.

    <div class="white">
    	<h2 class="white">White Chocolate</h2>
        <p>
        	White chocolate doesn’t qualify as genuine chocolate because it doesn’t contain chocolate solids (a.k.a. cocoa powder). 
             White chocolate is typically made from a blend of cocoa butter, milk solids, sugar, milk fat and lecithin — a fatty emulsifier that holds it all together.

    <div class="dark">
    	<h2 class="dark">Dark Chocolate</h2>
        <p>
        	Dark chocolate is chocolate without milk solids added. Dark chocolate has a more pronounced chocolate taste than milk chocolate,
             because it does not contain milk solids to compete with the chocolate taste. However, the lack of milk additives also means that dark chocolate is more prone to a dry, 
             chalky texture and a bitter aftertaste.
